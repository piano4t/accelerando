Approach

Whatever your musical goals and whatever your musical gifts, everyone needs a companion on the journey.  Music lessons with piano4t are designed around you to give direction, feedback,  encouragement and inspiration along the way.   

Always practical! 
Expect to be busy in your lessons. There will be some demonstration but lots of playing too. 

Something new every lesson!   Lots of chances to try out ideas, new fixes for tricky problems, or an introduction to a new technique.


Everyone can improvise! You will learn some simple tricks to create music that sounds great on the piano.  If you want to take this further, and start to record or write down your own compositions, we can do this too. 

Reading the music  Learning to read music takes time and effort, but it's worth it!  It gives you the key to unlock a vast treasure trove of music by composers across the centuries - and the new music of today.
